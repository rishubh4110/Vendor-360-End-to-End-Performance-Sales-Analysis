## 📖 Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end data analytics solution designed to optimize inventory and sales management for a retail/wholesale business. By analyzing vendor performance, sales trends, and inventory turnover, this project aims to provide actionable insights to reduce operational costs and maximize profitability.

## 🎯 Business Problem
Effective inventory and sales management are critical for optimizing profitability. Companies need to ensure they are not incurring losses due to inefficient pricing, poor inventory turnover, or vendor dependency.

**The specific goals of this analysis are to:**
* **Identify underperforming brands** that require promotional or pricing adjustments.
* **Determine top vendors** contributing to sales and gross profit.
* **Analyze the impact of bulk purchasing** on unit costs and margins.
* **Assess inventory turnover** to reduce holding costs and improve efficiency.
* **Investigate profitability variance** between high-performing and low-performing vendors.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Database:** SQLite (Embedded for high-performance handling of large datasets)
* **Data Analysis & Processing:** Python (Pandas, NumPy)
* **Visualization:** Power BI
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 File Structure & Workflow
This repository is organized to follow the data pipeline from ingestion to visualization:

1.  **`Ingestion_db.ipynb`**: Handles the ingestion of the massive raw dataset into a local SQLite database to optimize performance and avoid memory errors during processing.
2.  **`EDA.ipynb`**: Contains Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data distribution, check for outliers, and perform initial statistical checks.
3.  **`Vendor Performance Analysis.ipynb`**: The core analysis script. It executes complex SQL queries against the SQLite database, calculates KPIs, and generates the final processed data.
4.  **`output.csv`**: The clean, processed dataset generated by the analysis script, ready for visualization.
5.  **`Vendor Performance Analysis.pbix`**: The Power BI dashboard file containing interactive visualizations of the insights.

## 📊 Key Insights & Results
* *[Placeholder: Identified that Vendor X accounts for 40% of total profit despite lower sales volume.]*
* *[Placeholder: Brands A and B showed a 15% lower turnover rate, indicating a need for clearance strategies.]*
* *[Placeholder: Bulk purchasing reduced unit costs by 10% on average across top 5 categories.]*
